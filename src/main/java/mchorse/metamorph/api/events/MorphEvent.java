/**
 * Morph event
 * 
 * {@link MorphEvent.Pre} occurs when player gets morphed or demorphed. If player gets 
 * demorphed then {@link #morph} is null. Check for player's world property 
 * to get on which side this event is triggered.
 * 
 * This event is cancelable. If it's get canceled, then player won't demorph 
 * or morph. If you'll reassign {@link #morph}, then player will apply morph 
 * which you assigned (or demorph if you assign {@link #morph} to null).
 * 
 * You can also modify {@link #force} parameter which is responsible for 
 * forcing morphing (if not forced, player will morph only in case if he has 
 * acquired morph like given).
 * 
 * {@link MorphEvent.Post} is fired after a player successfully morphs or demorphs.
