**Metamorph** (from *[Metamorphosis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metamorphosis)*) – a Minecraft mod for 1.10.2 (there is also build for 1.9.4 and 1.11.2), which allow players to morph into different vanilla mobs. Heavily inspired by iChun's Morph mod and zacuke's Shape Shifter Z mod. 

## Install

Install [Minecraft Forge](http://files.minecraftforge.net/), download the latest stable version of jar file for available minecraft version. Put it in minecraft's `mods` folder, and launch the game.

After that, Metamorph mod should be installed and will appear in Minecraft's mods menu. If Metamorph didn't appear in the mods menu, then something went wrong.

## How to play

To morph into other creatures, you must to acquire a *morph* first. To acquire a *morph*, you have to kill a mob, then a ghost of a mob will appear (that's a *morph*), and when you'll pick it up, you'll acquire a *morph*.

Once you have at least one *morph*, you're able to transform into that *morph*. Use `[` and `]` keys for advancing through the list of *morphs*. There are also `'` and `\` keys for switching between morph variants (you'll see up and down arrows in the selection box if there are morph variants available). Use `enter` key for transforming into selected *morph*. To demorph, you scroll left until you focus character with your skin, and then press `enter` to demorph. Or you can press demorph key (which is `.` by default).

You retain your *morphs* even after death (although you can disable retaining of morphs after death in mod options). In creative mode, you can select any available *morph* via Creative Morph Menu which can be opened by pressing `B` key in the game. 

Survival Morph Menu can also be focused, for managing purposes, by pressing `N` key (default). There you can favorite, remove and filter morphs by favorites. You use the same keys to navigate morphs (`[`, `]`, `'` and `\`).

## About morphs

Every *morph* you equip or apply grant you different look, size, and health capacity. Except those properties, every *morph* also has special *abilities*, *attack* and *action*. 

*Abilities* give special properties to *morphs*. **Chicken** *morph* will slowly fall and get no fall damage. **Spider** and **CaveSpider** *morphs* will be able to climb on the wall. **Bat** *morph* will be able to fly and has a night vision.

*Attack* is an effect which is applied onto attacked entity. For example, if you hit some entity while being in **CaveSpider** *morph*, your target will gain **poison** potion effect. If you'll hit an entity while being in **VillagerGolem** *morph*, you'll throw your target high in the air.

*Action* is a special ability that is triggered by "action key" (which is `V` by default). Examples: in **Rabbit** *morph*, you'll jump high; in **Creeper** *morph*, you'll explode like a creeper, and so on.
